Hi! Welcome to my blog. I hope to use this as a place to keep people updated on current projects along with what is going on in my life and what I am studying!
Right now I am taking two Android programming courses on [Coursera][coursea] along with a computer networking course. I am also doing CS101 on [Saylor.org][saylor]. I work full time so it's a lot to take on, but I realized that I love it!
Hope you enjoy watching me learn and seeing what comes of it.
