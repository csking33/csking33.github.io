Spent the week reading more about Java and practicing coding in Java. I have definitely been getting better with knowing how classes should be broken out from the main method. 
Also, I finally understand the use for getters/setters and encapsulation.

The computer networking course has been taking a lot of my time as well. I think I'm learning a lot from it though.
