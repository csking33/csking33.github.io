	I've been spending a lot of time working on an Android app over the past week. You can see the project [here][github].
I'm working on it with a little group that I put together from reddit. I put up a post a while ago asking if anybody 
would be interested in working on an app so that people could learn together and it generated a bit of interest. So we've
been talking for a while and finally got started on a project. I think it helped me to get started knowing that others
were watching.

	I've learned a lot already from working on this app. It's helped me to grasp certain aspects of Java. Also, yesterday 
I had to use the debugging tools for the first time, as I couldn't track down a bug causing the app to crash.
